**Stop using GitHub.**

[GitHub and its parent company Microsoft willingly collaborate with those
who operate concentration
camps.](https://sneak.berlin/20200307/the-case-against-microsoft-and-github/)

Many in the open source community have [asked Microsoft/GitHub to stop
providing services to these people, and they have plainly
refused.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jpgy/open-source-community-changing-github-avatars-drop-ice)

Hundreds of people have signed [the
petition](https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0), and many GitHub
staff have quit.

People who oppose concentration camps and support human rights have a moral
obligation to shop elsewhere.  Do not continue to donate value to the
Microsoft/GitHub ecosystem.

I have migrated my repositories [away from here](https://git.eeqj.de/sneak), and [so should you](https://sr.ht).
